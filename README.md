# agrtoolset

Introduction:

agrtoolset is a temporary set of tools used for a quicker workflow with .agr files. It is based upon Dardhandrob's Source-AGR-Import-Export-FBX (AIOX) add-on for blender 2.8, but it has been changed so heavily i decided to put it up on GitHub.

Installation:

1.clone repo or download as .zip

2.extract .zip into a folder

3.in blender go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install..., and choose the export.py file.

Usage:
- press shift + comma (,) on your keyboard to bring up the pie menu
